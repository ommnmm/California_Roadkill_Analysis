## Roadkill definition
   animals being struck by motor vehicles on roads
   
  
## Impact
Roadkills have wide impact on humankind and wildlife.  

### 1. to human: cost and safety

animal roadkill causes human safety concerns and high cost that concerns governments and insurance agencies.  

### 2. to wildlife: extermination

human activities have exterminated 60% of wildlife in the last 40 years; reasons include over-consumption and diminished habitat,to which animal roadkills contribute. The Federal Highway Administration announced that roadkill is threatening 21 endangered animal species. 




## Goal
 This study uses data from California Roadkill Observations System to estimate:  
1. wildlife removed by roadkills in California,  

2. cost of roadkills to California resident and government,  
as well as making suggestions on public outreach and data collection techniques (mobile app development)
to increase data collection frequency and location accuracy.




## Result 
1. four million roadkills in California per year  
2. roadkill cost ~10 billions for California per year   
3. speed limit doesn't have an effect on the occurence of roadkills  

## Data
~40,000 roadkill entries webscraped from California Roadkill Observations System.  
The data was collected during 2010-2018 by citizen observers.  


## Efforts by California Roadkill Observations System
1. roadkill hotspot map & cost estimate:  
    comminucation with California Department of Transportation for building fences in hotspots, 
    where cost of building fences is an order cheaper than deer collision.  

2. real time hotspot map:  
    real time warning to drivers at hotspots. This needs much more and better location data to function. Currently
    only 15% of public data contains location information.
